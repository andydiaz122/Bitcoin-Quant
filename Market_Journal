- We are currently in a tradable-goods and domestic-manufacturing recession ... could be an opportunity for big growth, thus a good investment
- The Fed may know exactly what they are doing. They may take a long time to make possible for a soft-landing as a result of all the economic damage and money printing that has been exhausted over the years. They may be looking at the situation with the perspective and plan to manage this situation over a very-long time horizon of 10+ years to "slowly descend the plane from incredible heights"

Nov 29 conference with Felix Zulauf and Aruther Hayes 
- "inventories are piling up" ... this should lead to exporters lowering prices which means cheaper prices for goods
- post ukraine/russia war: 
	- trust has been loss (ex: nordstrom pipeline), russia may build some infrastructure to make trade easier with east (china)
	- we are living in new regime
	- countries around the world now rely more on china that the u.s for trade
	- "we will be living in a de-globalized economy where inflation will be more prevalent, progress will be slower do to efficiency slowing down"
	- "energy problem: the real problem is not this winter but next winter especially for the germans" ... which will bring the 2nd wave of inflation. The 2nd wave of inflation is where things become catastrophic and real economic damage will be done and felt. 
	"europe will be stuck with higher prices of energy structurally for a long time"

	- 1hr
